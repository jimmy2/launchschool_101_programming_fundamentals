# 101-109 - Small Problems > Easy 5 > After Midnight (Part 1)

# The time of day can be represented as the number of minutes before or after midnight. 
# If the number of minutes is positive, the time is after midnight. 
# If the number of minutes is negative, the time is before midnight.

# Write a method that takes a time using this minute-based format and returns the time
# of day in 24 hour format (hh:mm). Your method should work with any integer input.

# You may not use ruby's Date and Time classes.

def time_of_day(integer)
  hour = integer / 60 % 24
  minute = integer % 60
  if minute < 10
    minute = "0#{minute}"
  end
  if hour < 10 && hour >= 0
    hour = "0#{hour}"
  end
  "#{hour}:#{minute}"
end

# Their solution

# MINUTES_PER_HOUR = 60
# HOURS_PER_DAY = 24
# MINUTES_PER_DAY = HOURS_PER_DAY * MINUTES_PER_HOUR

# def time_of_day(delta_minutes)
#   delta_minutes =  delta_minutes % MINUTES_PER_DAY
#   hours, minutes = delta_minutes.divmod(MINUTES_PER_HOUR)
#   format('%02d:%02d', hours, minutes)
# end
