# Write a method that takes two arguments: the first is the starting number, 
# and the second is the ending number. Print out all numbers between the two
# numbers, except if a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz", if a number is
# divisible by 5, print "Buzz", and finally if a number is divisible by 3 and 5,
# print "FizzBuzz".
